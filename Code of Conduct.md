# Student Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge
As a member, contributor, and leaders, we commit to ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their age, body size, visible disability, invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, and sexuality identity and orientation, should experience a harassment-free experience in our group project.

We will be active and communicate in a manner which will help create an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy community.

## 2. Our Standards
Some of the examples of behavior that enhances a favorable environment in our group are:

* **Sharing sympathy and compassion** with the rest of the team members.
* **Showing deference towards contrasting views**, opinions and experiences.
* **Providing and receiving positive criticism**.
* **Admitting our error and apologizing** to the victims of our errors, and receive a lesson.

* **This is with the sole aim of focusing on what is not only good to us as individuals but also the general project grade.** 

Examples of unacceptable behavior are:

* The sexualized language or image.
* The use of trolling, insults or derogatory remarks as well as personal or political attacks.
* His or her harassment, either publicly or privately.
* Sharing personal information of other people without their direct consent.

## 3. Team Responsibilities & Workflow
To ensure we meet our deadlines, all 4 members agree to the following:

### A. Communication

* **Primary Channel:** Whatssap/Teams Group.
* **Response Time:** The response time that members are supposed to recognize the messages is within **24 hours**.
* **Meetings:** In case a member fails to meet a planned meeting, he or she should inform the group at least 1 hour before.

### B. Git & Code Contributions


* **No Direct Pushes to Main:** It is not allowed to make all changes on a different branch (e.g., feature/login-page) and verify them after that.
* **Commit Messages:** Should be descriptive (e.g. added login form styling, and not fixed stuff).
* **breaking Change:** When one of the members modifies his database structure or package.json, they should inform the group immediately to allow other people to re-build their Docker containers.

### C. Conflict Resolution
In the event of a disagreement:

* 1. We shall endeavor to solve it by in-your-face conversation.
* 2. In the case that the problem still remains, we will vote as a group (majority rules).
* 3. In case of the possibility of the item not being resolved, we will refer to the module leader.

## 4. Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines** and the **Contributor Covenant**, version 2.0.
